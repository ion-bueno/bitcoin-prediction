# Bitcoin market price prediction

The goal of the project is predicting the bitcoin market price, employing the past values of the own time series as well as other variables. These features are selected previously, thinking that they could ease the prediction of future values. 

The application is developed in a R markdown, **bitcoin_prediction.Rmd** where all steps are explained:

1. Data preprocessing and visualization tools.
2. Statistical tools to predict the values.
3. Machine learning tools for the same target.
4. Interpretation and conclusions.

It is also uploaded the html version, **bitcoin_prediction.html**.
